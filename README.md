# BMI-vs-Drinks
This analysis uses data from the 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Survey that the CDC conducts every year to examine if a correlation exists between one's number of alcohol drinks per day and the individual's BMI. As one has more alcoholic drinks per day we would assume a higher BMI. The data set contains over 400,000 observations on adults (18+) around the United States. The variables used are BMI, AVEDRNK (average number of drinks a day per 30 days), FEMALE (a gender variable), ACTIV (minutes active per day) and AGE.
